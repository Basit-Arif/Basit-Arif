👋 Hi, I’m Abdul Basit

I’m a developer who loves working with AI, data, and backend systems.
My interests are in math, programming, data science, and exploring new technologies that make life and work easier.

I enjoy building things like:
	•	⚙️ AI agents that automate real business workflows
	•	🧠 LLM-powered apps (RAG, chat systems, analysis tools)
	•	🗄️ Backend services using Python, FastAPI, Flask
	•	📊 Data pipelines & analytics tools
	•	🔍 Practical problem-solving—turning ideas into working systems

I’m always experimenting, learning, and improving my craft—one project at a time.

🌱 What I’m exploring now
	•	Building more agentic AI systems that reason and take actions
	•	Making clean, scalable backend architectures
	•	Learning tools that make automation faster and smarter
