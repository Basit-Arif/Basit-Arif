👋 Hi, I’m Abdul Basit

I’m a technical founder and developer who loves building things that actually solve problems. My work sits at the intersection of AI, backend engineering, and data — and I enjoy turning ideas into working systems quickly.

I care about clean engineering, practical automation, and using AI where it truly creates leverage, not hype.

I love building:
	•	⚙️ AI agents that automate real workflows for businesses
	•	🧠 LLM apps (RAG systems, analytics bots, reasoning agents)
	•	🗄️ Backend platforms using Python, FastAPI, Flask
	•	📊 Data pipelines that extract real insights
	•	🔍 Simple solutions to hard problems

I’m always experimenting, improving, and learning — one project, one idea at a time.

🌱 What I’m building & exploring
	•	Agentic systems that can decide, reason, and take actions
	•	Scalable backend architectures for AI-first products
	•	Automations that save hours for teams
	•	Using AI to turn messy data into usable decisions
